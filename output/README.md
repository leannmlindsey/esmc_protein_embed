# Output Directory

This directory is used to store all output files generated by the ESM-C protein embedding pipeline.

## Contents

When you run the various scripts, outputs will be organized here:

- **Embeddings**: `.npz`, `.pkl`, or `.npy` files containing protein embeddings
- **Visualizations**: `.png` files with UMAP/t-SNE plots
- **Coordinates**: `.coords.csv` files with 2D visualization coordinates
- **Similarities**: `.csv` files with similarity scores
- **Clusters**: Subdirectories containing cluster analysis results
- **Filtered Data**: `.tsv` files from filtering operations

## Note

All files in this directory (except this README) are ignored by git to keep the repository clean. Your output files will be stored here but not committed to the repository.
